You are working on the existing GitHub Pages PWA game "AA Master Mind".
Do NOT rewrite the whole project. Make minimal, clean changes and keep the retro travel-board style.

GOAL
Expand the existing "HOW TO PLAY" screen so it clearly explains ALL modes and key UI actions.
Keep the text short, readable on mobile, and consistent with the retro style.

REQUIREMENTS

1) Update HOW TO PLAY content (no new modes)
- Rework the how-to screen text to include these sections (use headings + short bullets):
  A) Basics
    - Goal: guess the 4-color code in 6 turns.
    - Duplicates allowed.
    - Black peg = correct color + correct position.
    - White peg = correct color in wrong position.
    - Time starts when you place the first peg (where applicable).
  B) Controls
    - Tap colors to fill the current row.
    - Tap a placed peg in the current row to remove it.
    - Undo = removes last peg.
    - Clear Row = clears the current row.
    - Submit Guess = checks your row (enabled only when 4 pegs are placed).
  C) Modes (must mention all)
    - SOLO: random secret, play anytime, results count in stats.
    - TWO PLAYERS: Player 1 sets the secret, pass device, Player 2 guesses.
    - MATCH CODE: both players enter the same code to get the same secret (fair offline race). Use a fresh code each match.
    - DAILY (Official): same secret for the whole day (UTC). One official try per device per day. Your result can appear on the leaderboard.
    - DAILY PRACTICE: same daily secret, unlimited practice, does NOT post to leaderboard / does not lock your daily attempt.
  D) Tips (very short)
    - Start with 4 different colors to map the code.
    - Use feedback to narrow positions, not just colors.
    - Duplicates are possible, so a color can repeat.

- Add a final single-line note:
  "Daily uses UTC day (not local time)."

2) Layout and styling
- Keep everything inside the existing howto flow-screen.
- Make it scannable:
  - Use small section titles (h3 or styled strong labels)
  - Short bullet lists
  - Avoid long paragraphs
- Ensure it looks good on iPad and small phones (no horizontal scrolling).

3) No functional changes
- Do not change game logic, modes, timers, or leaderboard.
- Only update index.html how-to content and minimal CSS if needed.

DELIVERABLE
Output complete updated contents of:
1) index.html
2) style.css (only if you changed it)
Do NOT output patch/diff.
