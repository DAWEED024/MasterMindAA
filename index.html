You are working on an existing GitHub Pages PWA game "AA Master Mind" (index.html, style.css, script.js, manifest.json, service-worker.js).
Do NOT rewrite the whole project. Add only the requested features with minimal, clean changes.

FEATURES TO ADD (must all work)

1) "HOW TO PLAY" screen
- Add a new button on the start screen: "HOW TO PLAY".
- When pressed, show a new flow screen (same styling as other flow screens) with a short explanation:
  - Goal: guess the 4-color code in 6 turns.
  - Duplicates allowed.
  - Black peg = correct color + correct position.
  - White peg = correct color in wrong position.
- Add a visible "← Back" button to return to the start screen.
- Do not change existing modes.

2) Sound effects toggle (SFX)
- Add a small toggle button or switch labeled "SFX: ON/OFF" visible on the start screen and also accessible in-game (e.g., in stats area or top header).
- Default: ON.
- Persist preference in localStorage (key: "aaMasterMindSfxEnabled").
- Implement simple SFX using Web Audio API (no external audio files):
  - "place peg" = short click/beep
  - "submit" = slightly different beep
  - "win" = short positive arpeggio
  - "lose" = short low tone
- IMPORTANT iOS/Safari: ensure audio context is unlocked only after a user gesture.
  - Implement an unlockAudio() helper that resumes AudioContext on first interaction (touchstart/mousedown/keydown).
  - Do not spam listeners; remove them after unlocking.
- If SFX is OFF, no sound plays.

Where to play SFX:
- On placing a color into the current row (addColorToCurrentRow) => "place peg" sound
- On submitGuess() => "submit" sound
- On finishGame(won) => win or lose sound

3) Match Code display in results
- In the result modal, when mode is MATCH_CODE, display:
  - "Match Code: XX-XXXX-XX"
- Add a "Copy Code" button in the modal when mode is MATCH_CODE.
  - Copies the match code to clipboard and briefly updates subtitle or button text to confirm.

4) Gentle haptic vibration (Android-friendly; safe no-op on iOS)
- Add very subtle vibration feedback using navigator.vibrate, but ONLY if supported:
  - On placing a peg: vibrate 10ms
  - On submit: vibrate 15ms
  - On win: vibrate pattern [20, 30, 20]
  - On lose: vibrate pattern [40]
- Must not throw errors on browsers that do not support vibration.
- Respect user preference: if SFX is OFF, vibration can still run (do NOT tie vibration to SFX), but keep it subtle.
  (Optionally you may add a separate toggle "HAPTIC: ON/OFF" only if it is minimal; otherwise always-on-if-supported is OK.)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Keep existing HTML structure and IDs as much as possible.
- Add new elements with new IDs/classes:
  - how-to-play button: id="how-to-btn"
  - how-to screen: id="howto-screen" with class "flow-screen hidden"
  - modal copy button: id="copy-result-code-btn" (hidden unless match mode)
  - sfx toggle: id="sfx-toggle"
- Update CSS minimally to match existing retro style:
  - Use same button styles as others.
  - Ensure the new screen is consistent with other flow screens.

DELIVERABLE
- Output the complete updated contents of:
  1) index.html
  2) style.css
  3) script.js
- Do NOT output patch/diff format. Output full files ready to paste.
- Ensure no console errors and everything works on iPadOS Safari + desktop Chrome.
